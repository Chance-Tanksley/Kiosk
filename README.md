# Kiosk
# My Kiosk project was the first major project from my MCA course. We were tasked with developing a program that would get the user input for simulated prices of grocery items and then getting a cash or card payment. It includedes a cashback option if the user is using a card. The program also opens aother program that stores data from the purchase.
